### Run Inference

Install the dependencies with the ``requirements.txt`` file.

Use the ``app.py`` file to run the inference. Alternatively you can run the ``quick_start_with_hugging_face.ipynb`` notebook in **jupyter** or similar environment.

**Note** - The Model and the Code requires a efficient cosumer GPU like **Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti Laptop GPU** to run the inference.
