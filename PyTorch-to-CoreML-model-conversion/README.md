This contains the code for **PyTorch to CoreML model conversion**. For more information - visit
[**PyTorch to CoreML model conversion**](https://www.learnopencv.com/pytorch-to-coreml-model-conversion/)

## Installation

All required libraries collected in the requirements.txt file. To create a new virtual environment and install the
requirements, you can use these commands:

```
$ virtualenv -p python3.7 venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the script

To convert any model from `torchvision.models` you can try our script by using this command:

```
$ python3 torch_to_coreml.py --model_name resnet18 --simplify
```

The `--model_name` argument should contain the name of any model from `torchvision.models`
