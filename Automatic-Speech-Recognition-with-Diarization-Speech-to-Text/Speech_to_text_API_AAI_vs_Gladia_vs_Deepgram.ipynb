Now he started to draw the old age pension in 1927, and 7 years ago, he got the president's bounty on his 100th birthday. Now he's from County Clare. He came up from Clare in 1940 to a land commission farm in Maynooth where he lives now.\\n\\nYou have seen a lot of changes, mister Fitzpatrick, in farming. What would you say was the biggest change?\\n\\nSpeaker 1: With machinery.\\n\\nSpeaker 0: And what sort of a machine\\n\\nSpeaker 1: do you\\n\\nSpeaker 0: think made the biggest impression?\\n\\nSpeaker 1: Well, the reaper and binders are graffing, but, by god, the one pulled caution up the ground and thrown a flap is a powerful one too.\\n\\nSpeaker 0: Well, you were you were saying you're at at the time you saw the mowing machine first, it it made a tremendous impression on you.\\n\\nSpeaker 1: Indeed. Because it is not how could it be done at all?\\n\\nSpeaker 0: What was the the reaction of the people at that time time to the mower machine,\\n\\nSpeaker 1: mister Scott? Money. If I wasn't mowing in it, I could afford it, but the mower would have it. And some of them, I think, you told\\n\\nSpeaker 0: me, wouldn't have it on the land at all. Well,\\n\\nSpeaker 1: and\\n\\nSpeaker 0: Do do you remember, cutting the harvest with the reap and hope?\\n\\nSpeaker 1: Oh, probably all of it. Quite for years years years. That's it. It's about quite.\\n\\nSpeaker 0: And how do you think that the ripen hook compares with the combine\\n\\nSpeaker 1: no You can't come by and just go in the morning, start to bid here, and just put a report on by and there wouldn't be no noise.\\n\\nSpeaker 0: Now you also remember, I think, a rather historic thing in the land history of this country, the Bovah, Burdike evictions.\\n\\nSpeaker 1: I remember.\\n\\nSpeaker 0: Could you could you describe for us what happened at those evictions? You were at them.\\n\\nSpeaker 1: I was at one of them. About about by.\\n\\nSpeaker 0: And what happened?\\n\\nSpeaker 1: That's, you know, that was very cruel. That's all children and women and the bullshit. Well, there was one of them thrown out, put in one day, everything in it, and the baby was only about 3 days old. And they were sitting they were throwing on the banks of the then go for jelly. Oh, it was cruel.\\n\\nSpeaker 0: And how about the type of food you had to eat at that time, mister Fisbati? What sort of what did you live on?\\n\\nSpeaker 1: What was it? We had to live there a long time on an Indian land and trouble.\",\n",

He's Mr Michael Fitzpatrick from Killenie, Maynooth. Now, he started to draw the old age pension in 1927 and seven years ago he got the President's bounty on his hundredth birthday. Now he's from County Clare. He came up from Clare in 1940 to a land commission farm in Maynooth where he lives now. You have seen a lot of changes Mr Fitzpatrick in farming. What would you say was the biggest change? Well machinery. And what sort of a machine would you think made the biggest impression? Well, I think it was the most powerful Well, the reaper and binder is a great one, but, by God, the one for cutting up the ground and throwing a crop is a powerful one too. Well, you were saying at the time you saw the mowing machine first, it made a tremendous impression on you. It did, because I didn't know how it could be done at all. What was the reaction of the people at that time to the mowing machine, Mr. Scott? I had great money, but I wasn't minding it. I could afford it, but the mowing got at it. And some of them I think you told me wouldn't have it on the land at all. Well, I had a good father, I said about our town's land, he wouldn't have it on the land. You see, ten men cut it, three and six months a day. Do you remember cutting the harvest with the reaping hook? Oh, all of it. Of course, for years and years and years, nothing else about cutting. And how do you think that the reaping hook compares with the combine at the present time? Oh, well, there's an awful difference. An awful difference I see anywhere. Because if you come round and slap your head there, if you put a rapier on the vine, there wouldn't be no mice. Now, you also remember, I think, a rather historic thing in the land history of this country, the Boddhike evictions. I do. Could you describe for us what happened at those evictions? You were at them. I was at one of them about five hours before Monday. And what happened? Ah, that was very cruel. There were children and women on the roadside. Well, there was one of them thrown out one day, I was in it, and the baby was only about three days old. And they were sitting, they were thrown on the bank of the river. Oh, it was cruel. And how about the type of food you had to eat at that time, Mr Fispartic? What sort of, what did you live on? Well, we had to live there a long time on an Indian man and plough.\",\"languages\":[\"en\"]},\"translation\":{\"success\":true,\"is_empty\":false,\"results\":[{\"languages\":[\"fr\"],\"full_transcript\":\"Je vais vous présenter à un homme assez remarquable. Il est M. Michael Fitzpatrick de Killenie, Maynooth. Maintenant, il a commencé à tirer la pension âgée en 1927 et il y a sept ans, il a reçu le bénéfice du Président à son centenaire. Il vient du comté Clare. Il est sorti de Clare en 1940 à une ferme de commission terrestre à Maynooth où il vit aujourd'hui. Vous avez vu beaucoup de changements M. Fitzpatrick dans l'agriculture. Qu’est-ce que tu dirais que c’était le plus grand changement? Une bonne machine. Et quel type de machine pensez-vous avoir fait la plus grande impression? Eh bien, je pense que c'était le plus puissant Eh bien, le reaper et le binder est un grand, mais, par Dieu, celui pour couper le sol et jeter une culture est un puissant aussi. Eh bien, vous aviez dit au moment où vous avez vu la machine à mouler pour la première fois, elle a fait une impression énorme sur vous. C’est vrai parce que je ne savais pas comment ça pouvait être fait. Quelle était la réaction des gens à l’époque à la machine à mouler, M. Le Scott? J’avais beaucoup d’argent, mais je ne me souviens pas. Je pouvais le permettre, mais le moulin en est arrivé. Et certains d'entre eux, je pense que vous m'avez dit qu'ils ne l'auraient pas sur la terre du tout. Eh bien, j'avais un bon père, j'ai dit de la terre de notre ville, il ne l'aurait pas sur la terre. Vous voyez, dix hommes le coupent, trois et six mois par jour. Vous souvenez-vous de couper la récolte avec le récolte? Oh, tout ça! Bien sûr, pendant des années, des années et des années, rien d’autre sur le couper. Et comment pensez-vous que l’aiguille de repousse est comparée à la combinaison actuelle? Oh, bien, il y a une terrible différence. C’est une différence que je vois partout. Parce que si vous venez en rond et que la tête s'y couche, si vous mettez un rapier sur la vigne, il n'y aurait pas de souris. Maintenant, vous vous souvenez aussi, je pense, d’une chose assez historique dans l’histoire terrestre de ce pays, les évacuations Boddhike. Je le fais. Pouvez-vous nous expliquer ce qui s’est passé lors de ces évacuations? Vous étiez chez eux. J'étais à l'un d'eux environ cinq heures avant lundi. Et ce qui s’est passé? Ah, c’était très cruel. Il y avait des enfants et des femmes sur la route. Eh bien, il y avait un d'eux jeté un jour, j'y étais, et le bébé n'était que environ trois jours. Et ils étaient assis, ils furent jetés sur la rive du fleuve. Oh, c’était cruel. Et que dire du type de nourriture que vous aviez à manger à ce moment-là, M. Fispartic? De quoi, de quoi avez-vous vécu? Eh bien, nous avions dû y vivre longtemps sur un homme indien et plough.\",\"utterances\":[{\"words\":[{\"word\":\"Je \",\"start\":1.16573,\"end\":1.28633,\"confidence\":0.33},{\"word\":\" vais \",\"start\":1.30643,\"end\":1.46724,\"confidence\":0.43},{\"word\":\" vous \",\"start\":1.46724,\"end\":1.58784,\"confidence\":0.25},{\"word\":\" présenter \",\"start\":1.62804,\"end\":2.05015,\"confidence\":0.71},{\"word\":\" à \",\"start\":2.05015,\"end\":2.13055,\"confidence\":0.02},{\"word\":\" un \",\"start\":2.13055,\"end\":2.25116,\"confidence\":0.51},{\"word\":\" homme \",\"start\":2.49236,\"end\":2.89437,\"confidence\":0.725},{\"word\":\" assez \",\"start\":2.93457,\"end\":3.45719,\"confidence\":0.76},{\"word\":\" remarquable.\",\"start\":3.55769,\"end\":3.75869,\"confidence\":0.96}],\"text\":\"Je vais vous présenter à un homme assez remarquable.\",\"language\":\"fr\",\"start\":1.16573,\"end\":3.75869,\"confidence\":0.5695000000000001,\"speaker\":0,\"channel\":0},{\"words\":[{\"word\":\" Il \",\"start\":4.562709999999999,\"end\":4.633064999999999,\"confidence\":0.27},{\"word\":\" est \",\"start\":4.633064999999999,\"end\":4.7034199999999995,\"confidence\":0.27},{\"word\":\" M. \",\"start\":4.74362,\"end\":4.984819999999999,\"confidence\":0.94},{\"word\":\" Michael \",\"start\":5.025029999999999,\"end\":5.26623,\"confidence\":0.56},{\"word\":\" Fitzpatrick \",\"start\":5.306430000000001,\"end\":5.90945,\"confidence\":0.6},{\"word\":\" de \",\"start\":5.9697499999999994,\"end\":6.1305499999999995,\"confidence\":0.43},{\"word\":\" Killenie, \",\"start\":6.27126,\"end\":6.63307,\"confidence\":0.48}],\"text\":\" Il est M.

He's Mr Michael Fitzpatrick from Killenie, Maynooth. Now, he started to draw the old age pension in 1927 and seven years ago he got the President's bounty on his hundredth birthday. Now he's from County Clare. He came up from Clare in 1940 to a land commission farm in Maynooth where he lives now. You have seen a lot of changes Mr Fitzpatrick in farming. What would you say was the biggest change? Well machinery. And what sort of a machine would you think made the biggest impression? Well, I think it was the most powerful Well, the reaper and binder is a great one, but, by God, the one for cutting up the ground and throwing a crop is a powerful one too. Well, you were saying at the time you saw the mowing machine first, it made a tremendous impression on you. It did, because I didn't know how it could be done at all. What was the reaction of the people at that time to the mowing machine, Mr. Scott? I had great money, but I wasn't minding it. I could afford it, but the mowing got at it. And some of them I think you told me wouldn't have it on the land at all. Well, I had a good father, I said about our town's land, he wouldn't have it on the land. You see, ten men cut it, three and six months a day. Do you remember cutting the harvest with the reaping hook? Oh, all of it. Of course, for years and years and years, nothing else about cutting. And how do you think that the reaping hook compares with the combine at the present time? Oh, well, there's an awful difference. An awful difference I see anywhere. Because if you come round and slap your head there, if you put a rapier on the vine, there wouldn't be no mice. Now, you also remember, I think, a rather historic thing in the land history of this country, the Boddhike evictions. I do. Could you describe for us what happened at those evictions? You were at them. I was at one of them about five hours before Monday. And what happened? Ah, that was very cruel. There were children and women on the roadside. Well, there was one of them thrown out one day, I was in it, and the baby was only about three days old. And they were sitting, they were thrown on the bank of the river. Oh, it was cruel. And how about the type of food you had to eat at that time, Mr Fispartic? What sort of, what did you live on? Well, we had to live there a long time on an Indian man and plough.\",\"utterances\":[{\"words\":[{\"word\":\"I'm \",\"start\":1.16573,\"end\":1.28633,\"confidence\":0.33},{\"word\":\" going

Maynooth where he lives now.\\n\\n8\\n00:00:29.868 --> 00:00:33.401\\n You have seen a lot of changes Mr Fitzpatrick in farming.\\n\\n9\\n00:00:34.164 --> 00:00:35.737\\n What would you say was the biggest change?\\n\\n10\\n00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:36.982\\n Well machinery.\\n\\n11\\n00:00:37.931 --> 00:00:41.866\\n And what sort of a machine would you think made the biggest impression?\\n\\n12\\n00:00:42.268 --> 00:00:42.369\\n Well, \\n\\n13\\n00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.896\\n I think it was the most powerful \\n\\n14\\n00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.291\\n Well, \\n\\n15\\n00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:44.828\\n the reaper and binder is a great one, \\n\\n16\\n00:00:45.248 --> 00:00:45.369\\n but, \\n\\n17\\n00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:45.772\\n by God, \\n\\n18\\n00:00:46.155 --> 00:00:50.308\\n the one for cutting up the ground and throwing a crop is a powerful one too.\\n\\n19\\n00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.430\\n Well, \\n\\n20\\n00:00:51.872 --> 00:00:55.188\\n you were saying at the time you saw the mowing machine first, \\n\\n21\\n00:00:55.892 --> 00:00:57.368\\n it made a tremendous impression on you.\\n\\n22\\n00:00:57.428 --> 00:00:57.750\\n It did, \\n\\n23\\n00:00:58.253 --> 00:01:00.888\\n because I didn't know how it could be done at all.\\n\\n24\\n00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:06.822\\n What was the reaction of the people at that time to the mowing machine, \\n\\n25\\n00:01:06.822 --> 00:01:06.903\\n Mr.\\n\\n26\\n00:01:06.903 --> 00:01:07.066\\n Scott?\\n\\n27\\n00:01:07.188 --> 00:01:07.835\\n I had great money, \\n\\n28\\n00:01:07.855 --> 00:01:09.008\\n but I wasn't minding it.\\n\\n29\\n00:01:09.128 --> 00:01:09.872\\n I could afford it, \\n\\n30\\n00:01:09.893 --> 00:01:12.448\\n but the mowing got at it.\\n\\n31\\n00:01:13.721 --> 00:01:17.056\\n And some of them I think you told me wouldn't have it on the land at all.\\n\\n32\\n00:01:17.196 --> 00:01:17.959\\n Well, \\n\\n33\\n00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:19.044\\n I had a good father, \\n\\n34\\n00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:20.931\\n I said about our town's land, \\n\\n35\\n00:01:21.313 --> 00:01:22.096\\n he wouldn't have it on the land.\\n\\n36\\n00:01:24.253 --> 00:01:24.554\\n You see, \\n\\n37\\n00:01:24.634 --> 00:01:25.699\\n ten men cut it, \\n\\n38\\n00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:27.566\\n three and six months a day.\\n\\n39\\n00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.807\\n Do you remember cutting the harvest with the reaping hook?\\n\\n40\\n00:01:33.816 --> 00:01:33.957\\n Oh, \\n\\n41\\n00:01:34.018 --> 00:01:34.422\\n all of it.\\n\\n42\\n00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.952\\n Of course, \\n\\n43\\n00:01:36.755 --> 00:01:38.401\\n for years and years and years, \\n\\n44\\n00:01:38.401 --> 00:01:39.466\\n nothing else about cutting.\\n\\n45\\n00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.726\\n And how do you think that the reaping hook compares with the combine at the present time?\\n\\n46\\n00:01:44.048 --> 00:01:44.169\\n Oh, \\n\\n47\\n00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.451\\n well, \\n\\n48\\n00:01:44.451 --> 00:01:45.780\\n there's an awful difference.\\n\\n49\\n00:01:47.311 --> 00:01:49.087\\n An awful difference I see anywhere.\\n\\n50\\n00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.333\\n Because if you come round and slap your head there, \\n\\n51\\n00:01:53.936 --> 00:01:55.225\\n if you put a rapier on the vine, \\n\\n52\\n00:01:55.225 --> 00:01:56.453\\n there wouldn't be no mice.\\n\\n53\\n00:01:56.876 --> 00:01:56.997\\n Now, \\n\\n54\\n00:01:57.137 --> 00:01:58.585\\n you also remember, \\n\\n55\\n00:01:58.625 --> 00:01:58.946\\n I think, \\n\\n56\\n00:01:59.067 --> 00:02:02.625\\n a rather historic thing in the land history of this country, \\n\\n57\\n00:02:02.745 --> 00:02:02.866\\n the \\n\\n58\\n00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.655\\n Boddhike evictions.\\n\\n59\\n00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:05.345\\n I do.\\n\\n60\\n00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.876\\n Could you describe for us what happened at those evictions?\\n\\n61\\n00:02:08.998 --> 00:02:09.794\\n You were at them.\\n\\n62\\n00:02:10.037 --> 00:02:15.816\\n I was at one of them about five hours before Monday.\\n\\n63\\n00:02:16.264 --> 00:02:16.876\\n And what happened?\\n\\n64\\n00:02:17.158 --> 00:02:17.279\\n Ah, that \\n\\n65\\n00:02:17.802 --> 00:02:19.332\\n was very cruel.\\n\\n66\\n00:02:20.498 --> 00:02:23.312\\n There were children and women on the roadside.\\n\\n67\\n00:02:23.732 --> 00:02:23.873\\n Well, \\n\\n68\\n00:02:23.873 --> 00:02:25.889\\n there was one of them thrown out one \\n\\n69\\n00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:26.312\\n day, I was in it, and \\n\\n70\\n00:02:26.873 --> 00:02:29.112\\n the baby was only about three days old.\\n\\n71\\n00:02:29.752 --> 00:02:30.637\\n And they were \\n\\n72\\n00:02:30.758 --> 00:02:33.092\\n sitting, they were thrown on the bank of the river.\\n\\n73\\n00:02:34.795 --> 00:02:34.917\\n Oh, \\n\\n74\\n00:02:34.998 --> 00:02:35.732\\n it was cruel.\\n\\n75\\n00:02:36.793 --> 00:02:41.750\\n And how about the type of food you had to eat at that time, \\n\\n76\\n00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:42.312\\n Mr Fispartic?\\n\\n77\\n00:02:42.372 --> 00:02:42.839\\n What sort \\n\\n78\\n00:02:43.083 --> 00:02:43.712\\n of, what did you live on?\\n\\n79\\n00:02:43.853 --> 00:02:44.294\\n Well, \\n\\n80\\n00:02:44.736 --> 00:02:48.652\\n we had to live there a long time on an Indian man and plough.\\n\"}]}],\"exec_time\":4.560376882553101,\"error\":null}}}"
