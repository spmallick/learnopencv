    "In the previous notebook on image classification, we used a densely connected Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) network to classify handwritten digits. However, one problem with using a fully connected MLP network for processing images is that image data is generally quite large, which leads to a substantial increase in the number of trainable parameters. And this can make it difficult to train such networks for a number of reasons. \n",

    "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) were developed to more effectively process image data. This is due in large part to the use of **convolution** operations utilized to extract features from images. This is a key feature of convolutional layers, called **parameter sharing**, where the same weights are used to process different parts of the input image. This allows us to detect feature patterns that are **translation invariant** as the kernel moves across the image. This approach improves the model efficiency by significantly reducing the total number of trainable parameters compared to fully connected layers. \n",

To facilitate the discussion, we will refer VGG-16 CNN architecture, as shown in the figure below. The model begins with five **convolutional blocks**, constituting the model's feature extraction segment. A convolutional block is a general term used to describe a sequence of layers in a CNN that are often repeatedly used in the feature extractor. The feature extractor is followed by the classifier, which transforms the extracted features into class predictions in the final output layer. VGG-16 was trained on the ImageNet dataset, which contains 1,000 classes. Therefore, the output layer contains 1,000 neurons whose values represent the probabilities that the input image corresponds to each class. The output with the highest probability is, therefore, the predicted class.\n",

As the input data passes through the network, the shape of the data is transformed. The spatial dimensions are (intentionally reduced) while the depth of the data is increased.

Other layers are also sometimes incorporated, but we will focus on these two layer types to keep things simple. Notice that we have explicitly specified the last layer of the network as SoftMax.

At the most basic level, the input to a convolutional layer is a two-dimensional array which can be the input image to the network or the output from a previous layer in the network. The input to the very first convolutional layer is the input image. The input image is typically either a grayscale image (single channel) or a color image (3 channels).\n",

Convolutional layers use filters to process the input data. The filter moves across the input, and at each filter location, a convolution operation is performed, which produces a single number. This value is then passed through an activation function, and the output from the activation function populates the corresponding entry in the output, also known as an **activation map** `(224x224x1)`. You can think of the activation map as containing a summary of features from the input via the convolution process.\n",

    " ### 3.2 The Convolution Operation (Input * Kernel)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can describe convolutional layers in more detail, we need to first take a small detour to explain how the convolution operation is performed. In a convolutional layer, a small filter is used to process the input data. In this example, we show how a`(6x6)` input is convolved with a `(3x3)` filter. Here we show a simple filter often used in image processing. The elements in a filter are collectively referred to as a **kernel**. However, it's important to note that in CNNs the elements in the kernel are weights that are learned by the network during training. \n",
    "\n",
    "The convolution operation consists of placing the filter over a portion of the input and multiplying the elements of the filter with the corresponding elements of the input. The resulting value is a single number representing the output of the convolution operation for a given filter location. The process is repeated by sliding the filter over the input image until the filter has been placed over each input section. Sliding the filter one pixel at a time corresponds to a stride of one. The filter location is shown in dark blue. This region is also referred to as the **receptive field**. Notice that the center of the filter is indicated in green. The convolution operation performed at each filter location is simply the dot product of the filter values with the corresponding values in the receptive field in the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sample calculation is provided for the first two filter locations so you can confirm your understanding of the operation. Notice that at each filter location, the operation produces a single number placed at the corresponding location in the output (i.e., the location in the output that corresponds to the center of the receptive field overlayed on the input slice).\n",

    "Notice that the output from the convolution has a smaller spatial size than the input slice. This has to do with how the filter is placed over the input so that it does not extend beyond the boundary of the input. However, padding techniques are often used to pad the input image so that the output is the same size as the input. Using a stride larger than one will also reduce the output size from the convolution operation. However, in the remainder of this notebook (for simplicity), we will assume a padding configuration that maintains the spatial size of the data in convolutional layers. All deep learning frameworks offer options for how to handle boundaries. We will not cover these details here, but you should be aware that these options exist."

The spatial size of a filter is a design choice, but it must have a depth of three to match the depth of the input image. In this example, we use a single filter of size `(3x3x3)`.\n",

There are a total of 27 trainable weights in this filter, plus a single bias term, for 28 total trainable parameters. Because we’ve chosen just a single filter, the depth of our output is one, which means we produce just a single channel activation map shown. When we convolve this single (3-channel) filter with the (3-channel) input, the convolution operation is performed for each channel separately. The weighted sum of all three channels plus a bias term is then passed through an activation function whose output is represented as a single number in the output activation map (shown in blue).\n",

    "In CNN architectures, it is typical that the spatial dimension of the data is reduced periodically via **pooling layers**. Pooling layers are typically used after a series of convolutional layers to reduce the **spatial size** of the activation maps. You can think of this as a way to summarize the features from an activation map. Using a pooling layer will reduce the number of parameters in the network because the input size to subsequent layers is reduced.

    "\n",
    "- The feature extractor is composed of convolutional blocks with a similar structure composed of one or more convolutional layers followed by a max pooling layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The convolutional layers extract features from the previous layer and store the results in activation maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pooling layers are often used at the end of a convolutional block to downsize the activation maps. This reduces the total number of trainable parameters in the network and, therefore, the training time required. Additionally, this also helps mitigate overfitting.\n",

    "And just one final reminder, in this notebook, we didn’t get into details associated with striding and padding options in convolutional layers. Obviously, those would affect the spatial shape of the data as it flows through the network. In many architectures, these options are configured so that the activation maps have the same spatial size as the input. But you should be aware that striding and padding options can affect the size of the activation maps.\n",

To keep things simple, we wanted to focus on how the input and output depth relate to each other in a convolutional layer via kernels and filters."
