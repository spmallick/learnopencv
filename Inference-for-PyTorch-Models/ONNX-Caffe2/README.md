# PyTorch Model Inference using ONNX and Caffe2

We show how to do inference with a PyTorch model using ONNX and Caffe2.

## Dependencies

torch  
torchvision  
onnx

## Create conda environment

```conda env create -f environment.yml```

## Download models
The required models can be downloaded from the following links:
[Animals Caltech](https://drive.google.com/open?id=14XvkumHXxGWed_osX_XpBRLOVA6v9WHl)

## Activate conda environment

```conda activate pytorch_inference```

## Outline
The enclosed notebook lets you
1. Export the PyTorch .pt model to ONNX model
2. Use the ONNX model for inference in Caffe2
