The `Custom_Object_Detection_using_YOLOv5.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook contains all the code and is one-click runnable. The experiments available in the notebook are:

* Training a small YOLOv5 model.
* Training a medium YOLOv5 model.
* Training a medium YOLOv5 model by freezing the first 15 blocks.

[You can run the notebook on Google Colab as well.](https://colab.research.google.com/github/spmallick/learnopencv/blob/master/Custom-Object-Detection-Training-using-YOLOv5/Custom_Object_Detection_using_YOLOv5.ipynb)
