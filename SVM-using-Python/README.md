There are **three types** of data:

1. Linear Data **without** noise.
2. Linear Data **with** noise.
3. Non-Linear Data **with** noise.

**Steps:**

1. `cd <folder_name>` (e.g. `cd Linear-Data-With-Noise`)
2. Run python file: `python3 <filename.py>`

The data is in every folder. (Left and Right points)

**Data Filenames:**

1. `points_class_0.txt` : Points of one class.
2. `points_class_1.txt` : Point of second class.
