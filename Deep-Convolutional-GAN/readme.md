## Package Dependencies

The repository also trains the Deep Convolutional GAN in both Pytorch and Tensorflow on [Anime-Faces dataset](https://github.com/bchao1/Anime-Face-Dataset). It is tested with the following CUDA versions.

- `Cuda-11.1`
- `Cudnn-8.0`

The Pytorch and Tensorflow scripts require [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install), [torch](https://pypi.org/project/torch/).  To get the versions of these packages you need for the program, use pip: (Make sure pip is upgraded. ` python3 -m pip install -U pip`)
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
```
