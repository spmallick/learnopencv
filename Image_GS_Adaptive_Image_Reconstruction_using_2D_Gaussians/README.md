# Image-GS: Adaptive Image Reconstruction using 2D Gaussians

This repository contains a README file having all the instructions and terminal commands in the exact order in which they have to be executed on the terminal to run the Image-GS Image Reconstruction Pipeline using 2D Gaussians. It contains a python script (model.py) which has to be replaced with the original python script, got cloned into the system while cloning the Image-GS repository. Because of some updates in the file sturucture, few imports are wrong, alongwith some script names, too, which is why, the replacement of the model.py python script is necessary.


It is part of the LearnOpenCV blog post - [Image-GS: Adaptive Image Reconstruction using 2D Gaussians](https://learnopencv.com/image-gs-image-reconstruction-using-2d-gaussians/).
