**Here we train YOLOv4 and YOLOv4-Tiny models with 4 different experimental settings on a pothole detection dataset. We also run inference in real-time using the trained models.**

* The `jupyter_notebook` directory contains the Jupyter Notebook which will run end-to-end with one click. You can either run it locally if you have CUDA and cuDNN installed. Or you can upload the notebook to Colab and run it in a GPU enabled environment.

- The `custom_inference_script` directory contains the customized `darknet_video.py` Python file. The Darknet code has been customized to show the FPS on the videos when running the inference. After cloning and building Darknet, replace the original `darknet_video.py` file with the one in the `custom_inference_script` directory.
