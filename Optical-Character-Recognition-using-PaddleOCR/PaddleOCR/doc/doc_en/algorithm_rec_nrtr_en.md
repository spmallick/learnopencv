Using MJSynth and SynthText two text recognition datasets for training, and evaluating on IIIT, SVT, IC03, IC13, IC15, SVTP, CUTE datasets, the algorithm reproduction effect is as follows:

|Model|Backbone|config|Acc|Download link|

## 2. Environment
Please refer to ["Environment Preparation"](./environment_en.md) to configure the PaddleOCR environment, and refer to ["Project Clone"](./clone_en.md) to clone the project code.

## 3. Model Training / Evaluation / Prediction

Please refer to [Text Recognition Tutorial](./recognition_en.md). PaddleOCR modularizes the code, and training different recognition models only requires **changing the configuration file**.

Training:

Specifically, after the data preparation is completed, the training can be started. The training command is as follows:

```
#Single GPU training (long training period, not recommended)
python3 tools/train.py -c configs/rec/rec_mtb_nrtr.yml

#Multi GPU training, specify the gpu number through the --gpus parameter
python3 -m paddle.distributed.launch --gpus '0,1,2,3'  tools/train.py -c configs/rec/rec_mtb_nrtr.yml
```

Evaluation:

```
# GPU evaluation
python3 -m paddle.distributed.launch --gpus '0' tools/eval.py -c configs/rec/rec_mtb_nrtr.yml -o Global.pretrained_model={path/to/weights}/best_accuracy
```

Prediction:

```
# The configuration file used for prediction must match the training
python3 tools/infer_rec.py -c configs/rec/rec_mtb_nrtr.yml -o Global.infer_img='./doc/imgs_words_en/word_10.png' Global.pretrained_model=./rec_mtb_nrtr_train/best_accuracy
```

## 4. Inference and Deployment

<a name="4-1"></a>
### 4.1 Python Inference
First, the model saved during the NRTR text recognition training process is converted into an inference model. ( [Model download link](https://paddleocr.bj.bcebos.com/dygraph_v2.0/en/rec_mtb_nrtr_train.tar)) ), you can use the following command to convert:

```
python3 tools/export_model.py -c configs/rec/rec_mtb_nrtr.yml -o Global.pretrained_model=./rec_mtb_nrtr_train/best_accuracy  Global.save_inference_dir=./inference/rec_mtb_nrtr
```

**Note:**
- If you are training the model on your own dataset and have modified the dictionary file, please pay attention to modify the `character_dict_path` in the configuration file to the modified dictionary file.
- If you modified the input size during training, please modify the `infer_shape` corresponding to NRTR in the `tools/export_model.py` file.

After the conversion is successful, there are three files in the directory:
```
/inference/rec_mtb_nrtr/
    ├── inference.pdiparams
    ├── inference.pdiparams.info
    └── inference.pdmodel
```


For NRTR text recognition model inference, the following commands can be executed:

```
python3 tools/infer/predict_rec.py --image_dir='./doc/imgs_words_en/word_10.png' --rec_model_dir='./inference/rec_mtb_nrtr/' --rec_algorithm='NRTR' --rec_image_shape='1,32,100' --rec_char_dict_path='./ppocr/utils/EN_symbol_dict.txt'
```

![](../imgs_words_en/word_10.png)

After executing the command, the prediction result (recognized text and score) of the image above is printed to the screen, an example is as follows:
The result is as follows:
```shell
Predicts of ./doc/imgs_words_en/word_10.png:('pain', 0.9265879392623901)
```

## 5. FAQ

1. In the `NRTR` paper, Beam search is used to decode characters, but the speed is slow. Beam search is not used by default here, and greedy search is used to decode characters.
