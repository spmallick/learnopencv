This repository contains code of our blog post [Optical Character Recognition using PaddleOCR](https://learnopencv.com/optical-character-recognition-using-paddleocr/).

We will use PaddleOCR to perform OCR on various scenarios like Receipts, ID-cards, Road signs and more. This repository also focuses on comparing various models provided by PaddleOCR that are PP-OCRv3, PP-OCRv2, SRN and NRTR.

## Requirements
- python-Levenshtein
- paddlepaddle-gpu
- paddleocr

## Notebooks
This repository contains two different notebooks for performing both the tasks as explained above.

- **[OCR_inference.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sanyam83/learnopencv/blob/master/Optical%20Character%20Recognition%20using%20PaddleOCR/OCR_inference.ipynb)**: This notebook contains inference code of PaddleOCR. In this, PP-OCRv3 along with text detector, recognizer and angle classifier are tested on various real life scenarios.

- **[OCR_comparison.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sanyam83/learnopencv/blob/master/Optical%20Character%20Recognition%20using%20PaddleOCR/OCR_comparison.ipynb)**: This notebook conatins the comparison code of the models provided by PaddleOCR toolkit. In this PP-OCRv3, PP-OCRv2, SRN and NRTR are tested on COCO text dataset.
